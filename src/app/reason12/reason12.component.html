        <p class="message">The twelfth reason I love you is...Your kisses. I don't know how to describe it but when I am kissing you I feel like i'm floating on another planet. Your kisses are one the things that I miss most about you. I know the next time I see you all this time we haven't been able to see each other will be worth it when I kiss you again.
