        <p class="message">The ninth reason why I love you is...We push each other to become better versions of ourselves. Whether it be us telling each other to get up out of bed, asking each other what did we eat, or asking have we been to the gym. I appreciate the fact that we hold each other accountable to obtain our dreams and goals.
