        <p class="message">The thirteenth reason why I love you is...How I feel when you were in my arms. Similar to how I feel about your kisses, this was another thing that I miss most about you. Although it was pretty hot when we were cuddling it was all worth it because I would feel like the luckiest guy in the world. I can wait to have you in my arms again.
